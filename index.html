In the foreground, a person pushes a trolley full of data along a path marked 'The Turing Way'. Along the path there are buildings representing key aspects of The Turing Way. These are ethics, collaboration, project design, reproducibility, and communication and outreach. People along the path are visiting the building. The path leads to a sunrise, stylised with data science iconography such as a pie chart and computer file. Text on the picture explains that The Turing Way aims to make this approach 'too easy not to do'." width="70%" >

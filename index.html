In the forground, a person pushes a trolly full of data along a path marked 'The turing Way'. Along the path there are buildings representing key aspects of The Turing Way. These are ethics, collaboration, project design, reproducibilty, and communication and outreach. People along the path are visiting the buildsing. The path leads to a sunrise, stylised with data science iconogrpahy such as a pie chart and computer file. Text on the picture explains that The Turing Way aims to make this approach 'too easy not to do'." width="70%" >

                        - Early interest in computers (can I get that picture)
                        - Lost interest in school, I.T.
                        - Studied Chemistry, MChem and PhD.
                        - Regained interest in computers during degree
                        - Exposed to FOSS and Linux in computational chemistry classes
                        - Passionate about Linux and FOSS since
                        - Now more confident with computers than chemistry, but not really a computer scientist
                        - Make some contributions to The Turing Way, now a member of the infrastructure working group

                        - Contributors using text editors/command line (like me), through to using the GitHub web interface
